# GraphLib
Graph library written in C#. The library makes it possible to model a graph data structure by adding vertices and edges. There are extension methods to the graph that enable various graph algorithms such as Breadth First Search and Depth First Search. The graph data structure is generic and it can contain any type of .NET object. In addition, the library is fully tested (see unittests project).

## Using the Library
To use the library import GraphLibs into your project, instantiate a new graph and add vertices and edges.
